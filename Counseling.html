      <p class="cadeheader"><strong>His name was Cade Gold.</strong></p>

      <p>A native of York, Pennsylvania, he arrived at Washington and Lee University in the fall of 2016. A year and a half later, he would be dead. He was 20 years old.</p>

      <blockquote>“You really don’t understand until you are surrounded by it a little bit more and it’s someone you actually know who’s going through it. So it’s sad that that’s what it takes for you to actually wake up, but I don’t know how else people can understand how significant of an issue it is without that.”</blockquote>

</figure>


      <p>By the following morning, President Will Dudley had sent an email to all students, faculty and staff under the subject line, “A Loss for the W&amp;L Community.” In the March 17, 2018, email, he detailed Gold’s student profile—potential major in biochemistry, varsity football, co-founder of the Pre-Health Club—and he invited all to a candlelight vigil on campus the next night. The university’s mental health resources were also available for students, he wrote. Four days later, Sidney Evans, vice president of student affairs, made the offer again.</p>

      <p>And then: Silence.</p>

      <p>The death of 21-year-old senior Kelsey Durkin in a 2013 drunk driving accident led to several changes at W&amp;L, including the creation of the Promise Committee to raise awareness about the dangers of  driving under the influence of alcohol. Gold’s suicide, in comparison, did not receive the same treatment. His death reverberates in a single bullet point in the university’s strategic plan. The university has set a fundraising goal of $3.5 million to establish an endowment to pay for health and counseling services.</p>

    <!--  <p>STRATEGIC PLAN GRAPHIC BY PROF BARRY</p>-->

      <p class="cadeheader">Kionte Burnette was in his first year at W&amp;L when he attempted suicide in October 2017.</p>

      <p>He is suing the university and a mental health counselor for negligence and gross negligence for failing to provide him with adequate care.</p>

      <p>He tried to hang himself in his dorm room, and a short time later, he intentionally threw himself off a gymnasium balcony, according to the lawsuit filed in Rockbridge County Circuit Court in January.</p>

      <p>Burnette played on Washington and Lee’s football team until he suffered a foot injury that required surgery, the lawsuit said. The injury worsened the depression and social anxiety he was feeling as a first-year student at W&amp;L, according to the lawsuit.

      <p>He met with a dean and told her he was depressed, and she then called in counselor Rallie Snowden to talk with him. According to the lawsuit, Burnette told Snowden that he wanted to kill himself. But the lawsuit said she did not perform a mental-health evaluation or suicide risk assessment, or urge him to go to the emergency room at the local hospital. Instead, the lawsuit said, she told him to go to classes.</p>

      <p>Burnette had an anxiety attack in class, the lawsuit said. He did not go to dinner or practice. Nor did he show up at the health center, according to the lawsuit.</p>

      <blockquote>“There’s a certain idea about the way a W&amp;L student should be: attractive, put-together competent, socially connected, and so forth. Students who deviate from that often feel sometimes socially neglected, sometimes really outwardly stigmatized of socially rejected.” &mdash;Dr Luder</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“W&amp;L is a uniquely socially-demanding school” &mdash;Dr. Luder</blockquote>

      <p>Anton Livshin, a senior who said he has struggled with mental health and substance abuse, has made it his mission to eradicate the stigma attached to seeking counseling. He revived the Active Minds Society, an organization that focuses on openly talking about mental health issues. He also founded a meditation group, the Lotus Society.</p>

      <figure class="interview" align="center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/328276376" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

      <p>On a national level, colleges and universities are experiencing a rise in student utilization of mental health resources.</p>

    <!--  <p>INSERT TOM'S GRAPHIC</p>-->

      <p>Student-run groups also provide support for students. SPEAK started in the late 2000s as an all-female student group to raise awareness of and prevent sexual assault and misconduct on campus. In the 2014-2015 academic year, SPEAK became a co-ed organization by joining with the all-male student group 1-in-4, which also was devoted to bringing attention to sexual assault on college campuses.</p>

      <p>The Washingtonian Society was established in 2017 and uses the Washingtonian House on campus as its base of operations. It organizes support groups and provides other services for students with alcohol or other substance abuse problems.</p>

      <p>The university also has a Peer Counseling Program, which is a team of student volunteers who help other students who are experiencing emotional problems.</p>

      <p>But the Counseling Center is the most heavily utilized of all. In the last few years, the frequency of students seeking counseling has skyrocketed.</p>

      <!--  <p>INSERT TOM'S GRAPHIC</p>-->

      <p>The Counseling Center has a six-person staff to meet the demands of 1,838 undergrads and about 300 law students. Only one counselor is a person of color. Another counselor specializes in LGBTQ+ issues.</p>

      <blockquote>“Between 2004 and [2018], the volume has increased 1000%.” &mdash;Dr. Luder</blockquote>

      <p>Senior Rebecca Licata, who withdrew from W&amp;L in winter 2013 to focus on her mental health, said she sought help from the counseling center when she came back to school in fall 2016. She said she was told she’d have to wait two weeks for an appointment.</p>

      <p>In the end, Rebecca had to wait two weeks before she finally got to see her counselor. Not only this, but students of minority backgrounds have mentioned issues in relating to the counselors at the Counseling Center. As of now, there are only six counselors on-duty, with only one person of color and one who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues. For students of more diverse backgrounds, some can feel the added burden of explaining their experiences to their counselor, eating up time during the much sought-after sessions.</p>

      <blockquote>“Students need to be able to reach out and not feel stigmatized. At the same time, they need to be able to reach out to somebody.” &mdash;Rebecca Licata</blockquote>

      <p>Students of diverse backgrounds said they have trouble connecting with the counselors at the center.</p>

      <p>Junior Joelle Simeu lamented that there are no black counselors. “I know that if that were to be a service that the school would provide, I could see more students of color going to the Counseling Center,” she said.</p>

      <p>Chase Isbell, an LGBTQ+ peer counsellor, said he thinks “queer resources” are worn thin.</p>

      <p>The student body, too, has taken the matter into their hands to expand mental health resources for their classmates. Student-run organizations like SPEAK, Washingtonian Society, Active Minds, and the Lotus Society, as well as the Peer Counseling program, are all run by students passionate about removing the stigma of mental health for a healthier, happier university climate.</p>

      <p>Livshin said students are becoming more open to engaging in discussions about mental health.</p>

      <p>“I definitely see a change,” he said. “The [campus climate] ... has been shifting towards a more authentic group of people. I can tell just from the freshmen coming to our meetings. I can tell from the first-years just responding to our willingness to talk about mental health. So, I really do see a positive trend on W&amp;L’s campus.”</p>
