<p>Washington and Lee is a unique liberal arts university because of its pre-professional emphasis, particularly with its accredited business school, the Williams School of Commerce, Economics and Politics.</p>

<p>The C-School, as it's known, is wildly popular among students and parents obsessed with jobs after graduation.</p>

<p>Senior Sam Bush said he chose to major in business administration and accounting as a practical matter.</p>

<p>&quot;My parents aren’t paying $70,000 a year so I can just explore myself,&quot; Bush said. &quot;I wouldn’t want to send my kid to a school and have to pay 70 grand a year just so they can explore themselves. You know, I want an end goal. I want to see a return on my investment.&quot;</p>

<figure class="interview" align="center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/328489086" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption class="no-right-float">Sam Bush, a senior</figcaption></figure>


<p>But Washington and Lee faculty and administrators are at odds with some students and their parents. The faculty and administrators want to entice C-School majors to take more courses and major in the College, the home of the traditional liberal arts disciplines.</p>

<p>Professor of Business Administration Robert Ballenger said the increasing enrollment in the C-School puts pressure on the faculty.</p>

<p>&quot;We feel, and I think the rest of the university feels, that we have too many business majors, and there’s only so many business faculty to go around,&quot; he said. &quot;And we are a liberal arts institution that happens to offer professional degrees.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the 1,838 undergraduates at Washington and Lee, 46 percent have declared at least one major in the C-School, according to university enrollment data. Forty-nine, or nearly 8 percent, of the C-School students are double-majoring with both disciplines in the Williams School.</p>


<p>The C-School offers majors in accounting and business administration, which are typical
business school fare. But it also includes economics and politics, which are usually embedded in the liberal arts.</p>

<p>In an effort to address demand, the university plans to gut and remodel Huntley Hall, which houses the C-School.
  It also will build an addition that will consume a popular patio area adjacent to the building. The cost will be
  nearly $19.4 million.</p>

<p>Robert Straughan, dean of the Williams school, said the expansion is needed because classroom availability has
  been tight for years.</p>

<p>&quot;The renovation and expansion of Huntley Hall is critical. We have been constrained by
classroom availability for many years. During most or all of my 19 years at W&amp;L, Huntley has
been the most heavily utilized classroom building on campus, well beyond the recommended
maximum rate.&quot;</p>

<h2>Jobs, jobs and more jobs</h2>

<p>What drives students to the C-School? Jobs. Students want to be in position to compete for the best, highest-paying entry level jobs on Wall Street and in corporate America—and parents want that too for their children.</p>

<p>And it’s working so well that C-School students often land jobs before they’ve bought their caps and gowns.</p>

<p>In 2017, The New York Times reported that the median income of Washington and Lee graduates at the age of 34 was $78,200. For men, it was $95,400, while women only earned a median income of $58,500.  Half of those graduates end up in the top 10 percent income echelon. But most of those students were born into the top income brackets, and they stayed there.</p>


<p>Students still pay attention to such elite rankings. &quot;One of my big draws to the school was, doing some research on it, I think they were rated number one on the Economist for jobs out of college,&quot; Bush said.</p>

<p>Another draw: Students don’t have to apply for admittance into the C-School. At W&amp;L, students are automatically accepted into the disciplines of their choice.</p>

<p>&quot;When I was applying to college, it was super important to me to have the school that didn’t have a business program that you had to apply to … you could kind of pick and choose from other places on campus but also opt in,&quot; said Caitlin Reardon, a junior business administration and politics double major. &quot;That was why I came to W&amp;L, and why the C-School was really appealing to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Students also like the way politics is taught at W&amp;L. At other schools, political science is usually the option, but it is more theoretical. In the C-School, students are taught about politics with a grounding in business.</p>

<p>Ballenger said many of the university’s most successful alumni majored in disciplines outside of the C-School.</p>

<p>&quot;There’s this misperception that business is a ticket to a good job, especially with parents,&quot; he said.</p>

<h2>Growing Pains</h2>

<p>The Williams School’s reputation as a job-generating machine attracts students to its courses to the point that it is increasingly difficult for C-School majors and non-majors to get a seat in some classes.</p>

<p>Senior Jennings Huntley said he declared a business administration major to navigate limited class availability during registration.</p>

<figure class="interview" align="center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/328489070" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption class="no-right-float">Jennings Huntley, a senior</figcaption></figure>


<p>Ballenger said students often major in the C-School not because they’re passionate about the subject. &quot;They’re doing it because they want access to business courses that maybe they personally want ... or their parents think they should have access to those courses,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Even students who are declared within the C-School can find themselves fighting for limited spots per class, which makes planning ahead for studying abroad difficult. Mattie Grant, a sophomore accounting major, said she got into classes she needed by chance in the 2019 winter term.</p>

<p>&quot;I will say there were a lot of times especially this semester where I was on waitlists and just happened to get into the class that I needed,&quot; Grant said. &quot;In the end, it all ended up working out fine but only because one person decided to drop a statistics class and one person transferred into a different business class.&quot;</p>

<p>Grant said she was worried that she couldn’t earn all the credits she needed to stay on track and go abroad.</p>

<p>Faculty in the Williams School are working on possible solutions, including a new finance-related major and a couple of interdisciplinary minors, that they hope will give students the exposure to business courses they want and provide them with the freedom to major in the liberal arts.</p>

<p>Several introductory classes have been combined to cut down on the number of classes that need to be taught. For example, managerial accounting and financial accounting were merged to create a general introduction to accounting course.</p>

<figure class="interview" align="center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/328489053" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption class="no-right-float">Jennings Huntley, a senior</figcaption></figure>


<p>Students said such changes are watering down the curriculum, rather than expanding their depth into the field of study.</p>

<p>Huntley said financial accounting is one of the most important classes a business administration or accounting major can take at Washington and Lee. He said the learning curve to the material is so steep that it justifies maintaining a stand-alone course solely for financial accounting.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel like for most students, it takes four weeks into the term until after the first test before it clicks, what accounting is,&quot; Huntley said. &quot;It’s almost like learning a new language in some senses.&quot;</p>

<p>Megan Philips, a junior business administration major, said she expects her C-School education to serve her well. &quot;I don’t know where I’ll be in the next 15 years, but I hope I’ll be able to apply what I learned in different classes to what I’m doing,&quot; she said. &quot;We’re not held to one concentration, so we can apply that knowledge to a lot of different jobs in the future.&quot;</p>
